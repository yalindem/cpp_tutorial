## Building

* Create CMakeLists.txt in the root of the project.
* create build folder in the root with "mkdir build"
* Navigate to the build and run "cmake .." to generate build files. This command will create build files based on the CMakeLists,txt configuration
* In the build directory, run the command "cmake --build ." to compile the code. You can also compile the code with different flags like with "cmake --build . --config Release" or "cmake --build . --config Debug"
* Then run the executable ./main
